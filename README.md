# downloader_ini_wizard.github.io

Managing `downloader.ini` files for the MiSTer FPGA can be complex. This project, `downloader_ini_wizard`, aims to simplify this process by providing user-friendly tools to create, edit, and understand these configuration files.

The core components of this project include:
*   A comprehensive metadata repository for all available MiSTer FPGA `downloader.ini` filter terms.
*   A web-based application, hosted on GitHub Pages, for an intuitive experience in creating and editing `downloader.ini` files.

## Project Roadmap
